# SWCharGen Custom Data
This is custom data for use with OggDude's SWChargen app. You will need to find the app on your own as I will not be uploading it here.

This custom data includes descriptions for all of the talents and careers/specializations as well as most weapons, items, ships, and species. However it does not contain everything, namely it is missing a lot of items and most of the stuff from the final books.

## Usage

To use this data you will need to have launched the app at least once to create the roaming data. Once you have done so you will find a folder called `SWCharGen` in your roaming folder (found by typing `%appdata%` in a file browser). Simply replace the `DataCustom` file with the one from this project, or if you've already added some custom data simply copy it into that.

## Updates
Updates will be infrequent as my group needs them. I will not respond to requests for new items to be added. If you want to add items fork the repo and add them yourself, it is not hard to use OggDude's provided data editor to do so.
